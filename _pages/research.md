> [**Detection of cartel evidence: a case study for Belém/PA and Santarém/PA using volatility models**](https://rsdjournal.org/index.php/rsd/article/view/21397)      
*Research, Society and Development*, [S. l.], v. 10, n. 13, p.                                                                                                        
This study used R to analyze fuel price data series and apply ARCH and GARCH family forecast models. In it, we model the series using analysis of variance models to understand the behavior of the errors. The main objective of the project is to understand if there are signs of cartel in the behavior of the series either in the variance or in the mean of the series.

> [**Analysis project of the historical series of fuels of municipalities in the state of Pará using Python**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ujuw85dBVfFrFYNTBzde2B_0GW9FhTiO/present?slide=id.p4)                                                                      
*29º Simpósio de Iniciação CIentífica e Tecnológica da USP - SIICUSP 2021*                                                                                           
This study used python to analyze data series and applied two filtering methodologies to the price series of retail fuel stations in the municipalities of Belém/PA, Marabá/PA and Santarém/PA in search of cartel evidence: i) the methodology used by the ANP based on the observation of price variation coefficients; and (ii) the methodology described by Ragazzo (2006) which consists of verifying the correlation coefficient between the coefficient of variation and the resale margin.
