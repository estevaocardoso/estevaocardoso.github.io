Welcome to my personal website!

I am an applied economist interested in Economic Development, Policy, Culture, and Trade (not necessarily in this specific order). I am currently a PhD student in Economics at São Paulo School of Economics - FGV.

When I'm not running regressions or coding, I usually enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/26967681) (mostly on the streets), playing my guitar, and spending time with friends and family.
