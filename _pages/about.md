Welcome to my personal website!

I am an applied economist interested in Economic Development, Policy, Culture, and History (not necessarily in this specific order).

I am currently a PhD student in Economics at São Paulo School of Economics - FGV.

My research focuses on applying econometric methods to answer causal questions related to the effects of political and cultural changes on human and firm behavior. Specifically, my research lies in two main areas. First, I am interested in studying the impact of investment target policies on small firms in Brazil, particularly how these policies can influence foreign investment decisions. My second area of research focuses on exploring the Economic Development of Brazilian society through the lenses of culture and economics.

When I'm not running regressions or coding, I usually enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/26967681) (mostly on the streets), playing my guitar, and spending time with friends and family.
